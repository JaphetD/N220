Javascript: is not Java, the language of the web, runs in the virtual machine.

ECMAScript:Technical specification of Javascript, Originally developed for Netscape Navigator(Mozilla Firefox).

Interperated: Is Interpretation.

Virtual machine: A program that does the interpretation  for you.

Values in code: Programming is about manipulating values and data. Values are stored in three major ways in a script:Variables,objects,and arrays. 
These values are stored in your computer's memory(RAM).

Variables: They hold values. Example: "Hello World" 

Basic Variable Types: Number:1052, Strings:Bonjour. 

Making a variable: var myName = "A. Name";
                   var age = 42;

                   console.log(myName)

                   myName = "Same variable, different name."

                   console.log(myName)

=(equal):Always sets a variable, puts something from the left into the right.

If statements:Lets you make decisions, based off boleans.

if (condition) {
	//Writes to the DOM
	document.write("Hello world");
}

Logical Operators: Lets myou make booleans by comparing two values. ==(equals) !=(does not equal)

console.log("Hello" == "Hello"):True

console.log("Hello" != "Hello"):False

Always should be double equal signs in IF statments, single equal signs in other statement 

How to get input from the user:

<input id= "txtInput" /> Give elements IDs so js can find them.

var txtInput = document.querySelector("#txtInput"); Finding the input in java.

<button onclick="getInput()"></button>

//This runs when a button is clicked
function getInput() { 
	//always get a value inside of a function
	var name = txtInput.value;
	
}

if(name == "Zenyatta") {
